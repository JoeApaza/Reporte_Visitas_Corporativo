          (default: 1)

        - max: the maximum number of connections the pool should contain
          (default: 2)

        - increment: the number of connections that should be added to the pool
          whenever a new connection needs to be created (default: 1)

        - connectiontype: the class of the connection that should be returned
          during calls to pool.acquire(). It must be oracledb.Connection or a
          subclass of oracledb.Connection (default: None)

        - getmode: how pool.acquire() will behave. One of the constants
          oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_WAIT, oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_NOWAIT,
          oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_FORCEGET, or oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_TIMEDWAIT
          (default: oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_WAIT)

        - homogeneous: a boolean indicating whether the connections are
          homogeneous (same user) or heterogeneous (multiple users) (default:
          True)

        - timeout: length of time (in seconds) that a connection may remain
          idle in the pool before it is terminated. If it is 0 then connections
          are never terminated (default: 0)

        - wait_timeout: length of time (in milliseconds) that a caller should
          wait when acquiring a connection from the pool with getmode set to
          oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_TIMEDWAIT (default: 0)

        - max_lifetime_session: length of time (in seconds) that connections
          can remain in the pool. If it is 0 then connections may remain in the
          pool indefinitely (default: 0)

        - session_callback: a callable that is invoked when a connection is
          returned from the pool for the first time, or when the connection tag
          differs from the one requested (default: None)

        - max_sessions_per_shard: the maximum number of connections that may be
          associated with a particular shard (default: 0)

        - ping_interval: length of time (in seconds) after which an unused
          connection in the pool will be a candidate for pinging when
          pool.acquire() is called. If the ping to the database indicates the
          connection is not alive a replacement connection will be returned by
          pool.acquire(). If ping_interval is a negative value the ping
          functionality will be disabled (default: 60)

        - user: the name of the user to connect to (default: None)

        - proxy_user: the name of the proxy user to connect to. If this value
          is not specified, it will be parsed out of user if user is in the
          form "user[proxy_user]" (default: None)

        - password: the password for the user (default: None)

        - newpassword: the new password for the user. The new password will
          take effect immediately upon a successful connection to the database
          (default: None)

        - wallet_password: the password to use to decrypt the wallet, if it is
          encrypted. This value is only used in thin mode (default: None)

        - access_token: expected to be a string or a 2-tuple or a callable. If
          it is a string, it specifies an Azure AD OAuth2 token used for Open
          Authorization (OAuth 2.0) token based authentication. If it is a
          2-tuple, it specifies the token and private key strings used for
          Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) token based authentication. If it is a callable, it returns
          either a string or a 2-tuple used for OAuth 2.0 or OCI IAM token
          based authentication and is useful when the pool needs to expand and
          create new connections but the current authentication token has
          expired (default: None)

        - host: the name or IP address of the machine hosting the database or
          the database listener (default: None)

        - port: the port number on which the database listener is listening
          (default: 1521)

        - protocol: one of the strings "tcp" or "tcps" indicating whether to

        - https_proxy: the name or IP address of a proxy host to use for
          tunneling secure connections (default: None)

        - https_proxy_port: the port on which to communicate with the proxy
          host (default: 0)

        - service_name: the service name of the database (default: None)

        - sid: the system identifier (SID) of the database. Note using a
          service_name instead is recommended (default: None)

        - server_type: the type of server connection that should be
          established. If specified, it should be one of "dedicated", "shared"
          or "pooled" (default: None)

        - cclass: connection class to use for Database Resident Connection
          Pooling (DRCP) (default: None)

        - purity: purity to use for Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP)
          (default: oracledb.PURITY_DEFAULT)

        - expire_time: an integer indicating the number of minutes between the
          sending of keepalive probes. If this parameter is set to a value
          greater than zero it enables keepalive (default: 0)

        - retry_count: the number of times that a connection attempt should be
          retried before the attempt is terminated (default: 0)

        - retry_delay: the number of seconds to wait before making a new
          connection attempt (default: 0)

        - tcp_connect_timeout: a float indicating the maximum number of seconds
          to wait for establishing a connection to the database host (default:
          60.0)

        - ssl_server_dn_match: boolean indicating whether the server
          certificate distinguished name (DN) should be matched in addition to
          the regular certificate verification that is performed. Note that if
          the ssl_server_cert_dn parameter is not privided, host name matching
          is performed instead (default: True)

        - ssl_server_cert_dn: the distinguished name (DN) which should be
          matched with the server. This value is ignored if the
          ssl_server_dn_match parameter is not set to the value True. If
          specified this value is used for any verfication. Otherwise the
          hostname will be used. (default: None)

        - wallet_location: the directory where the wallet can be found. In thin
          mode this must be the directory containing the PEM-encoded wallet
          file ewallet.pem. In thick mode this must be the directory containing
          the file cwallet.sso (default: None)

        - events: boolean specifying whether events mode should be enabled.
          This value is only used in thick mode and is needed for continuous

          (default: False)

        - externalauth: a boolean indicating whether to use external
          authentication (default: False)

        - mode: authorization mode to use. For example
          oracledb.AUTH_MODE_SYSDBA (default: oracledb.AUTH_MODE_DEFAULT)

        - disable_oob: boolean indicating whether out-of-band breaks should be
          disabled. This value is only used in thin mode. It has no effect on
          Windows which does not support this functionality (default: False)

        - stmtcachesize: identifies the initial size of the statement cache
          (default: oracledb.defaults.stmtcachesize)

        - edition: edition to use for the connection. This parameter cannot be
          used simultaneously with the cclass parameter (default: None)

        - tag: identifies the type of connection that should be returned from a
          pool. This value is only used in thick mode (default: None)

        - matchanytag: boolean specifying whether any tag can be used when
          acquiring a connection from the pool. This value is only used in
          thick mode. (default: False)

        - config_dir: directory in which the optional tnsnames.ora
          configuration file is located. This value is only used in thin mode.
          For thick mode use the config_dir parameter of init_oracle_client()
          (default: oracledb.defaults.config_dir)

        - appcontext: application context used by the connection. It should be
          a list of 3-tuples (namespace, name, value) and each entry in the
          tuple should be a string. This value is only used in thick mode
          (default: None)

        - shardingkey: a list of strings, numbers, bytes or dates that identify
          the database shard to connect to. This value is only used in thick
          mode (default: None)

        - supershardingkey: a list of strings, numbers, bytes or dates that
          identify the database shard to connect to. This value is only used in
          thick mode (default: None)

        - debug_jdwp: a string with the format "host=<host>;port=<port>" that
          specifies the host and port of the PL/SQL debugger. This value is
          only used in thin mode. For thick mode set the ORA_DEBUG_JDWP
          environment variable (default: None)

        - connection_id_prefix: an application specific prefix that is added to
          the connection identifier used for tracing (default: None)

        - ssl_context: an SSLContext object used for connecting to the database
          using TLS.  This SSL context will be modified to include the private
          key or any certificates found in a separately supplied wallet. This
          parameter should only be specified if the default SSLContext object
          cannot be used (default: None)

        - sdu: the requested size of the Session Data Unit (SDU), in bytes. The
          value tunes internal buffers used for communication to the database.
          Bigger values can increase throughput for large queries or bulk data
          loads, but at the cost of higher memory use. The SDU size that will
          actually be used is negotiated down to the lower of this value and
          the database network SDU configuration value (default: 8192)

        - pool_boundary: one of the values "statement" or "transaction"
          indicating when pooled DRCP connections can be returned to the pool.
          This requires the use of DRCP with Oracle Database 23.4 or higher
          (default: None)

        - use_tcp_fast_open: boolean indicating whether to use TCP fast open.
          This is an Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless (ADB-S) specific
          property for clients connecting from within OCI Cloud network. Please
          refer to the ADB-S documentation for more information (default:
          False)

        - handle: an integer representing a pointer to a valid service context
          handle. This value is only used in thick mode. It should be used with
          extreme caution (default: 0)

        All parameters are optional. A brief description of each parameter
        follows:

        - min: the minimum number of connections the pool should contain

        - max: the maximum number of connections the pool should contain

        - increment: the number of connections that should be added to the pool
          whenever a new connection needs to be created

        - connectiontype: the class of the connection that should be returned
          during calls to pool.acquire(). It must be oracledb.Connection or a
          subclass of oracledb.Connection

        - getmode: how pool.acquire() will behave. One of the constants
          oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_WAIT, oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_NOWAIT,
          oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_FORCEGET, or oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_TIMEDWAIT

        - homogeneous: a boolean indicating whether the connections are
          homogeneous (same user) or heterogeneous (multiple users)

        - timeout: length of time (in seconds) that a connection may remain
          idle in the pool before it is terminated. If it is 0 then connections
          are never terminated

        - wait_timeout: length of time (in milliseconds) that a caller should
          wait when acquiring a connection from the pool with getmode set to
          oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_TIMEDWAIT

        - max_lifetime_session: length of time (in seconds) that connections
          can remain in the pool. If it is 0 then connections may remain in the
          pool indefinitely

        - session_callback: a callable that is invoked when a connection is
          returned from the pool for the first time, or when the connection tag
          differs from the one requested

        - max_sessions_per_shard: the maximum number of connections that may be
          associated with a particular shard

        - soda_metadata_cache: boolean indicating whether or not the SODA
          metadata cache should be enabled

        - ping_interval: length of time (in seconds) after which an unused
          connection in the pool will be a candidate for pinging when
          pool.acquire() is called. If the ping to the database indicates the
          connection is not alive a replacement connection will be returned by
          pool.acquire(). If ping_interval is a negative value the ping
          functionality will be disabled

        - user: the name of the user to connect to

        - proxy_user: the name of the proxy user to connect to. If this value
          is not specified, it will be parsed out of user if user is in the
          form "user[proxy_user]"

        - password: the password for the user

        - newpassword: the new password for the user. The new password will
          take effect immediately upon a successful connection to the database

        - wallet_password: the password to use to decrypt the wallet, if it is
          encrypted. This value is only used in thin mode

        - access_token: expected to be a string or a 2-tuple or a callable. If
          it is a string, it specifies an Azure AD OAuth2 token used for Open
          Authorization (OAuth 2.0) token based authentication. If it is a
          2-tuple, it specifies the token and private key strings used for
          Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) token based authentication. If it is a callable, it returns
          either a string or a 2-tuple used for OAuth 2.0 or OCI IAM token
          based authentication and is useful when the pool needs to expand and
          create new connections but the current authentication token has
          expired

        - host: the name or IP address of the machine hosting the database or
          the database listener

        - port: the port number on which the database listener is listening

        - protocol: one of the strings "tcp" or "tcps" indicating whether to
          use unencrypted network traffic or encrypted network traffic (TLS)

        - https_proxy: the name or IP address of a proxy host to use for
          tunneling secure connections

        - https_proxy_port: the port on which to communicate with the proxy
          host

        - service_name: the service name of the database

        - sid: the system identifier (SID) of the database. Note using a
          service_name instead is recommended

        - server_type: the type of server connection that should be
          established. If specified, it should be one of "dedicated", "shared"
          or "pooled"

        - cclass: connection class to use for Database Resident Connection
          Pooling (DRCP)

        - purity: purity to use for Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP)

        - expire_time: an integer indicating the number of minutes between the
          sending of keepalive probes. If this parameter is set to a value
          greater than zero it enables keepalive

        - retry_count: the number of times that a connection attempt should be
          retried before the attempt is terminated

        - retry_delay: the number of seconds to wait before making a new
          connection attempt

        - tcp_connect_timeout: a float indicating the maximum number of seconds
          to wait for establishing a connection to the database host

        - ssl_server_dn_match: boolean indicating whether the server
          certificate distinguished name (DN) should be matched in addition to
          the regular certificate verification that is performed. Note that if
          the ssl_server_cert_dn parameter is not privided, host name matching
          is performed instead

        - ssl_server_cert_dn: the distinguished name (DN) which should be
          matched with the server. This value is ignored if the
          ssl_server_dn_match parameter is not set to the value True. If
          specified this value is used for any verfication. Otherwise the
          hostname will be used.

        - wallet_location: the directory where the wallet can be found. In thin
          mode this must be the directory containing the PEM-encoded wallet
          file ewallet.pem. In thick mode this must be the directory containing
          the file cwallet.sso

        - events: boolean specifying whether events mode should be enabled.
          This value is only used in thick mode and is needed for continuous
          query notification and high availability event notifications

        - externalauth: a boolean indicating whether to use external
          authentication

        - mode: authorization mode to use. For example
          oracledb.AUTH_MODE_SYSDBA

        - disable_oob: boolean indicating whether out-of-band breaks should be
          disabled. This value is only used in thin mode. It has no effect on
          Windows which does not support this functionality

        - stmtcachesize: identifies the initial size of the statement cache

        - edition: edition to use for the connection. This parameter cannot be
          used simultaneously with the cclass parameter

        - tag: identifies the type of connection that should be returned from a
          pool. This value is only used in thick mode

        - matchanytag: boolean specifying whether any tag can be used when
          acquiring a connection from the pool. This value is only used in
          thick mode.

        - config_dir: directory in which the optional tnsnames.ora
          configuration file is located. This value is only used in thin mode.
          For thick mode use the config_dir parameter of init_oracle_client()

        - appcontext: application context used by the connection. It should be
          a list of 3-tuples (namespace, name, value) and each entry in the
          tuple should be a string. This value is only used in thick mode

        - shardingkey: a list of strings, numbers, bytes or dates that identify
          the database shard to connect to. This value is only used in thick
          mode

        - supershardingkey: a list of strings, numbers, bytes or dates that
          identify the database shard to connect to. This value is only used in
          thick mode

        - debug_jdwp: a string with the format "host=<host>;port=<port>" that
          specifies the host and port of the PL/SQL debugger. This value is
          only used in thin mode. For thick mode set the ORA_DEBUG_JDWP
          environment variable

        - connection_id_prefix: an application specific prefix that is added to
          the connection identifier used for tracing

        - ssl_context: an SSLContext object used for connecting to the database
          using TLS.  This SSL context will be modified to include the private
          key or any certificates found in a separately supplied wallet. This
          parameter should only be specified if the default SSLContext object
          cannot be used

        - sdu: the requested size of the Session Data Unit (SDU), in bytes. The
          value tunes internal buffers used for communication to the database.
          Bigger values can increase throughput for large queries or bulk data
          loads, but at the cost of higher memory use. The SDU size that will
          actually be used is negotiated down to the lower of this value and
          the database network SDU configuration value

        - pool_boundary: one of the values "statement" or "transaction"
          indicating when pooled DRCP connections can be returned to the pool.
          This requires the use of DRCP with Oracle Database 23.4 or higher

        - use_tcp_fast_open: boolean indicating whether to use TCP fast open.
          This is an Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless (ADB-S) specific
          property for clients connecting from within OCI Cloud network. Please
          refer to the ADB-S documentation for more information

        - handle: an integer representing a pointer to a valid service context
          handle. This value is only used in thick mode. It should be used with
          extreme caution
        """
        pass
